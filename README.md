## 🧠 Tools and Libraries Overview

### **Flask**
[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) is a lightweight WSGI web application framework used to build the backend of the app and manage HTTP routes.

### **Scikit-learn**
[Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) is a popular machine learning library used for training the classification model that predicts the likelihood of heart disease.

### **Pandas**
[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is used for loading, preprocessing, and analyzing the structured health data used by the ML model.

### **NumPy**
[NumPy](https://numpy.org/) supports numerical computation and efficient array operations in the backend.

### **HTML5**
[HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) structures the frontend form where users input their medical information.

### **CSS3**
[CSS3](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) is used to style the frontend and enhance user experience with layout and design.

### **JavaScript**
[JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) provides dynamic functionality and interactions on the client-side.

### **Jupyter Notebook**
[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) was used for model development, training, evaluation, and initial testing before integrating into Flask.

### **Python**
[Python](https://python.org) is the core language powering both the ML model and the Flask backend logic.

## 💡 Project Workflow

### 1. Problem Identification
- **Challenge:** Heart disease is difficult to detect without expensive diagnostics or expert consultation.
- **Solution:** A simple web interface that uses a trained ML model to predict heart disease risk based on clinical input features.

### 2. Planning and Design
- Design a lightweight web app for easy accessibility and minimal setup.
- Use a user-friendly interface for medical data input.
- Provide fast and interpretable prediction results.

### 3. Development and Implementation

**Core Technologies:**
- **Flask:** Web framework to serve the ML model and handle requests.
- **Scikit-learn:** For model training and prediction.
- **Pandas & NumPy:** For data preprocessing.
- **HTML/CSS:** For frontend design.

**Developed Features:**
- User input form with fields such as age, sex, chest pain type, cholesterol, etc.
- Real-time prediction upon submission.
- Display of result with an interpretation of heart disease risk.

### 4. Testing
- Model evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
- Flask routes and frontend forms were tested locally to ensure smooth user experience.

### 5. Final Output
- Users can enter their health metrics.
- The app predicts whether the individual is at risk for heart disease.
- Instant results displayed in a clean UI with supportive messaging.
