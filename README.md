## üí° Project Workflow

### 1. Problem Identification
- **Challenge:** Heart disease is difficult to detect without expensive diagnostics or expert consultation.
- **Solution:** A simple web interface that uses a trained ML model to predict heart disease risk based on clinical input features.

### 2. Planning and Design
- Design a lightweight web app for easy accessibility and minimal setup.
- Use a user-friendly interface for medical data input.
- Provide fast and interpretable prediction results.

### 3. Development and Implementation

**Core Technologies:**
- **Flask:** Web framework to serve the ML model and handle requests.
- **Scikit-learn:** For model training and prediction.
- **Pandas & NumPy:** For data preprocessing.
- **HTML/CSS:** For frontend design.

**Developed Features:**
- User input form with fields such as age, sex, chest pain type, cholesterol, etc.
- Real-time prediction upon submission.
- Display of result with an interpretation of heart disease risk.

### 4. Testing
- Model evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
- Flask routes and frontend forms were tested locally to ensure smooth user experience.

### 5. Final Output
- Users can enter their health metrics.
- The app predicts whether the individual is at risk for heart disease.
- Instant results displayed in a clean UI with supportive messaging.
